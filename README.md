# üõ©Ô∏è Quadcopter Path Planning Simulation in ROS2 environment using both PX4, and ArduPilot Frameworks 

This project focuses on the design and simulation of drones for advanced agricultural applications. It was developed as part of my internship experience.

---

Overview:

This repository demonstrates the integration of ROS2, PX4, and Gazebo to simulate intelligent drone systems for applications such as

üçã Harvesting mangoes using a robotic cutting mechanism

üêí Scaring monkeys using real-time detection and deterrent spraying

üå¥ Detecting palm tree pests and performing precision spraying

Key Features:

‚úÖ Drone simulation using ROS2, PX4, and Gazebo

‚úÖ Integrated URDF models exported from Fusion 360 Design Software

‚úÖ Performed 2D and 3D simulations using MAVROS, ArduPilot SITL, and PX4 SITL

‚úÖ Developed smart agriculture applications with cutting-edge features

‚úÖ Designed and implemented custom cutting mechanisms for fruit harvesting

‚úÖ Applied deep learning algorithms for mango and pest detection

‚úÖ Enabled real-time monkey detection using YOLOv8 and implemented safe deterrent systems
