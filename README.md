# Quadcopter Path Planning Simulation using ROS2 with PX4 and ArduPilot Frameworks

## Overview

This project focuses on the design and simulation of drones for advanced agricultural applications. It was developed as part of an internship and demonstrates the use of modern robotic simulation tools to automate various farm-related tasks. The system is designed using the ROS2 framework and integrates both PX4 and ArduPilot for simulation control.

The drone system is tested in simulation for three key agricultural scenarios:
- Harvesting mangoes using a robotic cutting mechanism
- Scaring monkeys using real-time detection and deterrent spraying
- Detecting palm tree pests and executing precision spraying

## Key Features

- Drone simulation developed using ROS2, PX4, and Gazebo
- URDF models exported and integrated from Fusion 360 designs
- 2D and 3D drone simulations conducted using MAVROS, PX4 SITL, and ArduPilot SITL
- Agricultural task automation developed through mission planning
- Custom robotic tools designed for harvesting
- Deep learning models applied for mango and pest detection
- YOLOv8 used for real-time monkey detection and deterrent response

## Technologies Used

- ROS2 Humble
- PX4 Autopilot
- Ignition Gazebo Fortress
- Micro XRCE-DDS
- Fusion 360 with URDF Export Plugin
- Python, MAVROS, QGroundControl

## Outcomes

- Successfully simulated cutting, detection, and deterrent-based tasks in agriculture
- Developed a fully integrated ROS2 environment with PX4 SITL support
- Created autonomous navigation and mission planning pipelines using QGroundControl
